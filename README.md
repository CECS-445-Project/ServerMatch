# ServerMatch

## What is ServerMatch?
Server Match is an app that caters specifically to servers, by offering easy to manage menu options and a system of filters to assist in offering recommendations to hungry customers. With over 2.6 million servers within the United States alone, a less daunting Point of Sale (POS) system that focuses on efficiency and accessibility is necessary for retailers and servers with less tech experience.

Server Match makes maintaining a list of menu items easier than ever with features like simple menu addition options, quick cart and menu updates, and a variety of bubble tags to filter through the menu. Its portability as a mobile-app also makes it an ideal option for small businesses with limited physical space or funds.
